# Radio Interferometry Demo

This StreamLit application demonstrates flat-sky interferometric imaging, where the measurement plane (i.e. UV plane) is the Fourier dual of the image plane. The app shows how increasing the number of antennas leads to better UV sampling and thus better image reconstructions. Choose between different antenna array layouts, different model images, or make your own! Try it out!

Run locally as:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
